# quiplash-bot

Designed for Quiplash 2

To run `python3 main.py <roomcode>`

- Make sure the bot is not the VIP player - it cannot currently hit the "Everybody's Here" button.
- If it gets stuck and ctrl+c doesn't trigger keyboard interrupt, you can invoke a force quit by typing the word `exit` into the exit_flag.txt file.
